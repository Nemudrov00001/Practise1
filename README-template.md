## Overview

We worked together with Zhansaya on the Article preview component project, completed them separately but with joint efforts.

### Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal component layout depending on the screen size of their device
- See social media sharing links when they click on the "Share" icon.


### Links

At the bottom of the screen, links to their summaries and where the project itself was taken from were added. Also added links to us in social networks.

## My process


The creation of the complete HTML structure of the site after the creation of the css structure.
Created without using Bootstrap. The script was written in HTML.

### Built with

- HTML5 semantic markup
- Custom CSS properties
- Flexible drawer
- CSS Grid
- JS Library
- Response structure
- For styles
- I took the colors from the downloaded documents
- also the use of icons (https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons?d=gallery&p=2&c=food )


###What I learned

Using icons in HTML. I studied the new svg format. Also adding icons via <i class> (https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons?d=gallery&p=2&c=food )





### Continued development

Basically, I have learned a lot for myself during the creation of this project and I think that I will take similar challenges further for development.
